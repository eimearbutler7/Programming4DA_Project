# Programming for Data Analysis Project (10 credits)

This repository contains the Programming for Data Analysis Project(Nov/Dec 2018).

The primary document is the Jupyter Notebook "Programming4DA_Project.ipynb".

All references and sources used to support the code creation are documented within the ipynb file.  

NOTE: much research and code was prepared while I spent significant time travelling for work this month and was added to the Jupyter Notebook over a small numebr of days while I was home and had access to the computer running Anaconda/Python etc. The activity tracker may not look very impresive in git hub but activities were happening offline
