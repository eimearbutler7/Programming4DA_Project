# Programming for Data Analysis Project (10 credits)

This repository contains the Programming for Data Analysis Project(Nov/Dec 2018).

The primary document is the Jupyter Notebook "Programming4DA_Project.ipynb".

To run this document you must have installed software to run python code (https://www.python.org/), for example the Anaconda package (https://www.anaconda.com/).

By running each cell in succession, it will generate a dataframe of randomly generated numbers that are somewhat reflective of real life real estate sales data. 

All references and sources used to support the code creation are documented within the ipynb file. No other datasets are required.
